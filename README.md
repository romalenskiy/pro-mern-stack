## About

This application was created according to the [Pro MERN Stack (1st edition)](https://www.apress.com/cn/book/9781484226520) book by [Vasan Subramanian](https://github.com/vasansr).

Here, I am practicing my [React](https://reactjs.org/) skills and trying myself in NodeJS backend (with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)).
